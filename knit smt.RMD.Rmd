#c)
#Based on the simulation results, the following is the estimated length of a game for each service rule:
# - The expected length of a game under service rule A is projected to be expected_length_A points (where the server is the winner of the preceding point). This means that when service rule A is followed, it takes roughly expected_length_A points for one player to win 2 points and the game.
# - The expected length of a game under service rule B is calculated to be expected_length_B points (where the server is the loser of the preceding point). This suggests that when service rule B is followed, it takes about expected_length_B points for one player to win 2 points and win the game.

#d)
#1)Player performance consistency: The simulation assumes that the players' performance is consistent throughout the game and that the probability of earning a point under each service rule appropriately represent their actual performance. If player performance varies over time or due to external circumstances such as fatigue or injury, the simulation findings may be invalid.
#2)Players with equal skill levels: The simulation assumes that both players have equal skill levels, with the only difference being the service rule being followed. If the participants have major skill discrepancies, the results may not correctly represent the game's outcomes. In actuality, player skill levels might fluctuate, influencing game dynamics and outcomes.
#3)Point independence: The simulation assumes that the outcome of each point is independent of prior points, which means that the chances of winning a point do not alter based on the outcome of previous points. This may not always be the case in real-world settings, as players may be swayed by momentum, psychological variables, or strategy alterations based on recent outcomes.

#As n goes to infinity, the random variable Sn will display the following properties:

#Random walk behavior: The random walk Sn, n 1 may display particular tendencies as n goes to infinity, such as becoming more symmetric and centered around 0, with the absolute values of the steps becoming less relevant relative to the overall behavior of the random walk. Depending on the precise probabilities of the steps and their relationship to one another, the random walk may also display qualities such as recurrence or transience.

#Distribution: Due to the central limit theorem, when n goes to infinity, the distribution of Sn may converge to a Gaussian distribution (also known as a normal distribution).The central limit theorem says that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables tends to be regularly distributed, regardless of the form of the initial distribution.

#Mean: Sn's mean can be computed by multiplying the expected value of each individual random variable by n, given that the expected value exists. Because Xn has a mean of 0 (due to the equal odds of +1 and -1 steps), the mean of Sn will be 0 for all values of n.

#Variance: Sn's variance can be computed by adding the variances of each individual random variable and multiplying by n, given that the variances exist. In this situation, because Xn has variance 1 (owing to equal probabilities of +1 and -1 steps), Sn has variance n for all values of n.
